Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has seen exponential growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) in the past year, with over $80 billion locked in May 2021. Using DeFi TVL as an index for blockchain adoption, observing that Solana had only $1 billion in TVL in June 2021 signals huge future growth potential, given Solana’s 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), 400 millisecond block times, and scaling according to Moore’s Law. Serum is an example of a core protocol leveraging Solana’s technology to build a fast central limit order book DEX to power DeFi. We believe that the protocol with the highest usage in this ecosystem will be an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based DEX that deposits liquidity into Serum and allows for permissionless liquidity pool creation by end users.

Atrix is an AMM built on Solana which utilizes Serum’s order books and allows for permissionless liquidity pool and farm creation. Atrix will provide users and projects the best experience for swapping on and adding liquidity to Serum, and interacting with farms.
