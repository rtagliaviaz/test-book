# Liquidity Pools spanish
---

Users can create liquidity pools for any Serum market. Depositing liquidity in these pools will return Atrix LP tokens (ALP) which represent a proportional share of the liquidity in the pool. ALP tokens can then be used as money legos in other protocols, or can be staked in Atrix farms.

There is a SOL crank fee to help subsidize cranking the Atrix pool to keep it up to date. 50% of the inital liquidity deposit is locked to ensure enough liquidity for future Serum orders. A better solution is being implemented to locked liquidity across all deposits and not just the initial one.
