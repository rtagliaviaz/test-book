# Fees
---

Atrix has no deposit or withdrawal fees. Atrix generates fees like markets makers do on order books. It places order with a 0.20% increase in price, effectively creating a 0.20% fee. All fees are kept by Atrix LPs.

Mechanisms for protocol revenue generation will be announced in the coming weeks.
